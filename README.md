# Neural Networks Ensembling for Digit Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an ensemble of neural network models for digit classification. The ensemble includes fully connected, locally connected, and convolutional classifiers, each trained on preprocessed digit images. By combining the predictions of these models, we aim to enhance the classification accuracy through the strengths of each model architecture.

## Features
- Ensemble of neural network models for enhanced classification accuracy.
- Integration of fully connected, locally connected, and convolutional classifiers.
- Preprocessing of digit images for optimal model training.
- Evaluation of model ensemble performance on a test dataset.
